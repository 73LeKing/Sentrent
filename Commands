PLEASE READ

- The Mute And Unmute Commands Are Very Percise At The Moment, Please Make Sure Both The Muted Role
And Member Role Are Spelled Exactly The Same With Correct Capitalization

- If The Member Role Is Not Called "Member" And The Muted Role Is Not Called "Muted" The Commands Will Not Work
- The Commands Also Do Not Work If The User Has More Then The "Member" Role (Sorry For This, I Am Working On Fixing It)
